#My App Portfolio
Project built for the Udacity Android Nanodegree


##Description:
Throughout the Udacity Android Nanodegree, there are a total of six Android apps students are asked to complete.  For the first project, we were asked to create an App that would showcase all of the completed Nanodegree Apps.  This app is a simple App that will eventually create an intent to launch all further projects.  For now, it just launches a toast when buttons are clicked.

##Getting Started
This sample uses the Gradle build system.  To build this project, use the "gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

##Features:
- Basic Material Design
- Toasts
